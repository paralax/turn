A TURN server written in Go that is designed to be scalable, extendable and embeddable out of the box.
For simple use cases it only requires downloading 1 static binary, and setting 3 options.

See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for the the features it offers, and future goals.

## Getting Started
### Quick Start
If you want just a simple TURN server with a few static usernames `simple-turn` will perfectly suit your purposes. If you have
custom requirements such as a database proceed to extending.

`simple-turn` is a single static binary, and all config is driven by environment variables. On a fresh Linux AWS instance these are all the steps you would need.
```
$ wget -q https://github.com/pions/turn/releases/download/1.0.0/simple-turn-linux-amd64
$ chmod +x simple-turn-linux-amd64
$ export USERS='user=password foo=bar'
$ export REALM=my-server.com
$ export UDP_PORT=3478
$ ./simple-turn-linux-amd64
````

To explain what every step does
* Download simple-turn for Linux x64, see [release](https://github.com/pions/turn/releases) for other platforms
* Make it executable
* Configure auth, in the form of `USERNAME=PASSWORD USERNAME=PASSWORD` with no limits
* Set your realm, this is the public URL or name of your server
* Set the port you listen on, 3478 is the default port for TURN

That is it! Then to use your new TURN server your WebRTC config would look like
```
{ iceServers: [{
  urls: "turn:YOUR_SERVER"
  username: "user",
  credential: "password"
}]
```
---

If you are using Windows you would set these values in Powershell by doing. Also make sure your firewall is configured properly.
```
> $env:USERS = "user=password foo=bar"
> $env:REALM = "my-server.com"
> $env:UDP_PORT = 3478
```
### Extending
See [simple-turn](https://github.com/pions/turn/blob/master/cmd/simple-turn/main.go)

pion-turn can be configured by implementing [these callbacks](https://github.com/pions/turn/blob/master/turn.go#L11) and by passing [these arguments](https://github.com/pions/turn/blob/master/turn.go#L11)

All that `simple-turn` does is take environment variables, and then uses the same API.


### Developing
For developing a Dockerfile is available with features like hot-reloads, and is meant to be volume mounted.
Make sure you also have github.com/pions/pkg in your path, or you can exclude the second volume mount.

This is only meant for development, see [demo-conference](https://github.com/pions/demo-conference)
to see TURN usage as a user.
```
docker build -t turn .
docker run -v $(pwd):/usr/local/src/github.com/pions/turn -v $(pwd)/../pkg:/usr/local/src/github.com/pions/pkg turn
```

Currently only Linux is supported until Docker supports full (host <-> container) networking on Windows/OSX

## RFCs
### Implemented
* [RFC 5389: Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5389)
* [RFC 5788: Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5766)

### Planned
* [RFC 6062: Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) Extensions for TCP Allocations](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6062)
* [RFC 6156: Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) Extension for IPv6](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6156)
